# CLAUDE.md — cyd-scanner

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What this project is

**cyd-scanner** is counter-surveillance firmware for detecting Flock Safety
cameras and similar surveillance hardware (ALPR cameras, covert wireless cameras,
tracking beacons) by their RF signatures. It runs on a two-board system:

- **ESP32-2432S028R "CYD"** — the host: touchscreen UI, 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi/BLE scanning,
  storage, and display of detections.
- **ESP32-C5 DevKit** — a radio co-processor adding **5 GHz Wi-Fi 6** and
  **802.15.4 (Zigbee/Thread)** coverage the CYD's ESP32 cannot provide.

The goal is a portable, self-contained scanner that passively observes nearby RF
(Wi-Fi APs/clients, BLE advertisements, 802.15.4 devices), matches them against
signatures of known surveillance gear (e.g. MAC OUI ranges, SSID patterns, probe
behavior), and surfaces detections on the CYD's touchscreen.

### Scope / ethics

This is a **defensive, passive, privacy-research** tool. It observes broadcast RF
that any receiver can hear. Keep it that way:
- **Passive detection only** — no jamming, deauth, injection, or any active
  interference with other devices' operation.
- No capture or storage of third-party payload content beyond what's needed to
  classify a device (identifiers, signal metadata).
- When in doubt about whether a feature crosses from "detect" into "attack/DoS,"
  stop and ask.

## Hardware

Two boards. Full pin tables and quick reference:
**[hardware/PINOUT.md](hardware/PINOUT.md)** — read this before writing any pin-level code.

| Board                 | Role            | Radios                                              |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ESP32-2432S028R (CYD) | Host + UI       | Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz b/g/n, BT Classic + BLE 4.2           |
| ESP32-C5 DevKit       | Radio co-proc   | Wi-Fi 6 2.4 **+ 5 GHz**, BLE 5.0, 802.15.4          |

Datasheets, pinout diagrams, and board images live under
[hardware/boards/](hardware/boards/). When new reference material is added there,
update [hardware/PINOUT.md](hardware/PINOUT.md) accordingly.

### Key pin facts to remember
- **CYD display** (ILI9341/ST7789 SPI): MOSI 13, MISO 12, SCLK 14, CS 15, DC 2, backlight 21.
- **CYD touch** (XPT2046, separate bus): CLK 25, CS 33, MOSI 32, MISO 39, IRQ 36.
- **CYD SD**: CS 5, MOSI 23, SCK 18, MISO 19.
- **CYD free GPIO** for the C5 link / sensors: 22, 26, 27, 35 (input-only), serial header 1/3.
  GPIO26 is free because **no speaker is fitted** (the on-board audio amp header is unused).
- **ESP32-C5** console UART0 on 11/12; USB-Serial/JTAG on 13/14; strapping pins 8/9.
- ⚠️ **ESP32-C5 pins 25 & 26 are UNVERIFIED / possibly swapped** vs. online docs.
  Follow the numbers printed on the physical board (which the repo's edited pinout
  JPEG and PINOUT.md match), but **test before using** either pin. Prefer other GPIO
  for critical signals until confirmed. See the caveat in [hardware/PINOUT.md](hardware/PINOUT.md).

## Architecture: two boards, one project

Each board is a separate MCU with its own firmware binary, so each gets its **own
PlatformIO environment** — but both live in **one project/repo** because they share
a UART link protocol and are developed together.

- **CYD is the master.** It drives the UI and 2.4 GHz scanning, and sends scan
  commands to the C5 over UART.
- **C5 is the scanning co-processor.** It runs Wi-Fi (esp. 5 GHz) / BLE / 802.15.4
  scanning and streams detections back to the CYD.
- **Phone link (future):** the CYD will also expose BLE (GATT) or Wi-Fi (SoftAP +
  web server) to a phone. This is CYD-only firmware and does not change the project
  structure — but note the CYD's ESP32 must then juggle display + touch + 2.4 GHz
  scan + phone radio + UART link at once. Offloading heavy scanning to the C5 is
  what keeps that budget viable.

Planned layout:

```
src/
  cyd/            # CYD host firmware      → [env:cyd]
  c5/             # ESP32-C5 firmware      → [env:c5]
lib/
  link_protocol/  # shared UART message structs — compiled into BOTH envs
```

`build_src_filter` per env keeps each board from compiling the other's sources.
Anything under `lib/` is auto-included, so the shared protocol stays in sync by
construction.

## Build & tooling

This is a **PlatformIO** project (see [platformio.ini](platformio.ini)).

- `[env:cyd]` — board `jczn_2432s028r`, `build_src_filter = +<cyd/>`.
- `[env:c5]` — board `esp32-c5-devkitc-1` (verified against the installed pioarduino
  platform), `build_src_filter = +<c5/>`, `board_build.partitions = huge_app.csv`
  (Wi-Fi + BLE overflow the default 1.3MB app partition).
- Both use the pioarduino espressif32 platform + Arduino framework.

### Flashing the ESP32-C5 (important gotcha)

The C5 DevKit has **two** USB-C ports:
- **Native "USB" port** (enumerates as VID `303A:1001`, USB-Serial/JTAG) — **use this
  to flash.** Auto-download works with no button presses. Serial console also comes
  out here because the env sets `-D ARDUINO_USB_MODE=1 -D ARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=1`.
- **"UART" port** (external bridge, VID `2E3C:5740`) — **does NOT flash reliably**:
  its auto-reset is only half-wired, so esptool fails with "No serial data received"
  even after manual BOOT+RST. Only use it as a plain serial console (and then only
  with `CDC_ON_BOOT=0`).

The CYD flashes normally over its single CH340 micro-USB/USB-C port (auto-reset works;
the first upload attempt occasionally glitches — just retry). COM port numbers are
not stable across replugs; identify boards by USB VID:PID (CYD = CH340 `1A86:7523`,
C5 native = `303A:1001`).

Build/flash each board independently:

```bash
pio run -e cyd -t upload -t monitor   # build + flash + monitor the CYD
pio run -e c5  -t upload -t monitor   # build + flash + monitor the C5
pio run                               # build all envs
pio device monitor -e cyd             # serial monitor only
```

### Inter-board link (working — hard-won notes)

The CYD⇄C5 UART link (CYD GPIO22/27 ⇄ C5 GPIO4/5, GND) is validated end to end:
the CYD commands the C5, which scans dual-band Wi-Fi and streams `Detection` frames
back (5 GHz included). Things that matter, learned the hard way:

- **Wiring must be mechanically solid.** Loose dupont/JST contacts pass small frames
  (Ping) but drop the larger detection burst. The `LINK_MONITOR` build mode in both
  `main.cpp` (heartbeat + live loss counter on the CYD screen/LED) is the tool for
  hunting bad contacts — flip it on, reseat wires, watch loss go to 0%.
- **The protocol is strictly synchronous request/response.** The CYD sends ONE
  command, then waits for the C5's closing `Status(scanning=0)` before sending
  anything else. Do NOT interleave pings or a second command mid-scan — the C5
  blocks during `WiFi.scanNetworks()` and can't read, so extra commands pile up in
  its RX buffer and the two boards desync. (The C5 also flushes stale RX after a
  scan as a safety net.)
- **Scan timeout must exceed a full dual-band scan.** A 2.4+5 GHz scan can take
  ~10 s; the CYD's scan timeout is 20 s. (A future improvement is async/per-band
  scanning so the UI isn't blocked ~10 s per refresh.)
- **Bigger RX buffers**: both sides call `setRxBufferSize()` before `begin()` so a
  ~1.5 KB detection burst fits without overflow.
- **C5 link UART uses the XTAL clock** (`setClockSource(UART_CLK_SRC_XTAL)` before
  `begin()`) so Wi-Fi PLL activity can't shift its baud. Good practice on any ESP32
  UART that runs alongside Wi-Fi. (For the original-ESP32 CYD, the equivalent is
  `UART_CLK_SRC_REF_TICK` — relevant only once the CYD does its own Wi-Fi scanning.)
- Link runs at 115200 (see `LINK_BAUD` in `link_protocol.h`).

### Scanner architecture (current)

- **C5 = continuous async scanner.** It runs Wi-Fi dual-band scans asynchronously
  (`WiFi.scanNetworks(true)` polled from `loop()`, ~3 s gap between scans) and BLE
  continuously (NimBLE callback), merging both into a shared **detection table**
  (dedup by source+MAC, 30 s TTL, mutex-guarded because the BLE callback runs in a
  separate task). Scanning never blocks the link.
- **CYD = poller + UI + logger.** Every ~2 s it sends `StartScan`, the C5 instantly
  dumps its current table (fast, no blocking scan), and the CYD shows per-source
  counts (2.4 GHz / 5 GHz / BLE) + the strongest devices, sorted by RSSI.
- **SD logging (CYD).** First-seen devices (dedup by source+MAC for the session) are
  appended to `/scanlog.csv`: `epoch,ms_since_boot,lat,lon,source,mac,rssi,channel,name`.
  `epoch`/`lat`/`lon` are populated once the phone app has sent time + GPS (0/blank
  before that); `ms_since_boot` is always present.
- SD is on its own HSPI bus (display=VSPI, link=UART1), so no bus contention. Touch
  is not instantiated in the scanner build, leaving HSPI free for SD.

### Phone link + web app (Web Bluetooth)

- **CYD BLE GATT peripheral** (`src/cyd/phone.*`, NimBLE) advertises as `CYD-Scanner`
  with one service (`9a1e0000-…`) and four characteristics: time-sync (write, epoch
  secs), GPS (write, "lat,lon"), command (write, "1"/"0" = download on/off), and
  status (read/notify, "key=val;…"). BLE peripheral coexists with the Wi-Fi AP.
- **Web app** `webapp/index.html` — a standalone page that MUST be served over HTTPS
  (Web Bluetooth + geolocation both require a secure context). Host it (e.g. GitHub
  Pages) and open in **Chrome on Android** (Web Bluetooth is unsupported on iOS
  Safari). It connects over BLE, auto-syncs phone time, watches/pushes GPS, shows
  live counts, and triggers log download.
- **Log download over Wi-Fi** (`src/cyd/webshare.*`): when the app sends the download
  command, the CYD raises a SoftAP + HTTP server and shows a **QR code** on screen
  (Wi-Fi join string). The phone scans it to join, then opens `http://192.168.4.1`
  to pull `scanlog.csv`. (A QR can't carry the whole log — it just bootstraps the
  Wi-Fi join.) Download mode pauses scanning; it ends when the app sends "0" or the
  phone disconnects.
- Needs `board_build.partitions = huge_app.csv` (BLE + Wi-Fi + web server + TFT).

## Subagents (`.claude/agents/`)

A specialized agent suite is available (adapted from the owner's other firmware project):
- **orchestrator** — entry point for multi-step tasks; delegates to the others.
- **architect** — design/planning, board-split + flash/RAM trade-offs (read-only).
- **fixer** — implements C++ for CYD/C5 (read-write).
- **tester** — runs `pio run -e cyd`/`-e c5`, reports build + flash/RAM.
- **reviewer** — code quality, memory/concurrency, link-protocol correctness (read-only).
- **security** — enforces passive-only scope, captured-data privacy, attack surface (read-only).
- **hardware-docs** — datasheets/pinout images → pin tables & docs; keeps `pins.h` ↔ `PINOUT.md`.

## Reading datasheets (PDF)

The Read tool renders PDF pages via poppler (`pdftoppm`, installed). If Read reports
`pdftoppm is not installed` (stale PATH after a fresh install — fixed by restarting the
session), convert pages manually and Read the PNGs:
```bash
pdftoppm -png -r 150 -f <first> -l <last> "hardware/.../file.pdf" "<tmp>/pg"
pdftotext -layout "hardware/.../file.pdf" -   # text-only extraction
```
Don't commit rendered pages. The `hardware-docs` agent handles this end to end.

## Conventions

- Keep pin definitions centralized (a `pins.h` / config header per board), sourced
  from [hardware/PINOUT.md](hardware/PINOUT.md) — do not scatter magic GPIO numbers.
- Match the surrounding code's style; this is embedded C++/Arduino.
- Prefer non-blocking scanning loops; the UI must stay responsive.
- Log to the USB console UART, keep the inter-board link on a separate UART.
